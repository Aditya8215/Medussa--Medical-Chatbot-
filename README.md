# Medussa - Medical Chatbot

Medussa is an AI-powered **RAG-based chatbot application** designed to assist users with health-related queries, specifically leveraging domain knowledge from books on **pulmonary diseases**. It combines advanced retrieval and reasoning techniques to provide accurate, context-aware, and reliable responses.

## Current Capabilities

* **Domain-Specific Conversational AI**: Trained on pulmonary disease books for precise and trusted responses.
* **Hallucination Control**: Identifies and informs when data is *not* present in the knowledge base.
* **Scalable Architecture**: Deployed on AWS with a robust backend.

## Tech Stack

* **LangChain + RAG** for retrieval-augmented generation
* **Weaviate** as the vector database
* **Gemini 2.5 Pro** as the LLM
* **Flask** for backend
* **AWS** for deployment

## Planned Enhancements

1. Implementation of **Advanced RAG techniques**
2. Expanding to **more datasets and medical topics**
3. Building a **Knowledge Graph** to improve reasoning and relationships
4. Integrating a **Disease Checker Module**
